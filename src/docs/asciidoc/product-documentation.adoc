Test your plugin against different versions of Gradle as part of your build. This plugin extends the power that the new
https://docs.gradle.org/2.13/userguide/test_kit.html[GradleTestKit] brings without having to actually author code. It rather allows plugins authors to write functional tests
that looks like normal Gradle projects (multi-project is supported). This also makes it easier to create sample projects
that can directly be used in documentation.

NOTE: *If you are using a Gradle version < 2.13, it will run in legacy mode and behave like the 0.5.5 version of the plugin*.
