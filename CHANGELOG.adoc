for a specific release, please visit the http://ysb33r.github.io/gradleTest[plugin website].

== Roadmap - 2.0

* Legacy mode removed.
* Only supports compatibility tests against Gradle 3.0 or later.
* Allow for more than one build file per project
* Allow for assigning a name pattern for the gradle distribution download

== Roadmap - 1.1

// tag::changelog[]
=== Bugs

* https://github.com/ysb33r/gradleTest/issues/76[#76] - File attributes are lost during copy.
// end::changelog[]

== Breaking changes

* Now requires a minimum JDK7 irrespective of version Gradle. This means that if you run this version in legacy mode with an old version of Gradle you are still going to require JDK7.
